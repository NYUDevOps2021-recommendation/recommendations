# Recommendations
CSCI-GA.2820-003 DevOps and Agile Methodologies Fall 2021


## Description

The recommendations resource is a representation a product recommendation based on another product. In essence it is just a relationship between two products that "go together" (e.g., radio and batteries, printers and ink, shirts and pants, etc.). 
It could also recommend based on what other customers have purchased like "customers who bought item A usually buy item B". Recommendations should have a recommendation type like cross-sell, up-sell, accessory, etc. This way a product page could request all of the up-sells for a product. 
(Hint: an up-sell is a more full featured and expensive product that you recommend instead of the one they initially want to buy, 
cross-sells are other items just like this one with similar features and price.) 
You should use enumerations to represent the different recommendation types.
